"""CRUD service for the vm_leases table.

LeaseService owns all direct DB access for leases. The LeaseWatchdog and
the system controller's check-leases endpoint both call this service; neither
touches the DB directly.

Lifecycle transitions:
  pending  → active    advance_pending()      — lease_start_utc has passed / is None
  active   → releasing begin_releasing()      — lease_end_utc passed, check job submitted
  releasing→ released  mark_released()        — check confirmed VM gone; storefront patched
  releasing→ forced    mark_forced()          — grace period elapsed; storefront patched anyway
  *        → cancelled mark_cancelled()       — explicit pre-expiry cancellation

All mutation methods use the pattern: fetch-within-session, mutate, commit,
expunge, re-fetch for return — matching HostService exactly.
