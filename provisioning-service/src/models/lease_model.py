"""Pydantic models for the VM lease API.

LeaseCreate  — request body for POST /api/v1/leases
LeaseUpdate  — request body for PATCH /api/v1/leases/{id}
LeaseResponse — serialised view returned by all lease endpoints
LeaseListResponse — wraps a list of LeaseResponse for list queries

The storefront calls POST /api/v1/leases after a VM has been provisioned and
the lease window is known (i.e., after _do_shutdown succeeds in
action_executor.py). The provisioning service's LeaseWatchdog then polls the
vm_leases table, submits a check Ansible job to confirm VM cleanup, and calls
back to the storefront's PATCH /api/v1/admin/portfolio/resources/{resource_id}
endpoint when the lease is confirmed released.

The storefront_url and storefront_admin_key are global settings on the
provisioning service (settings.toml: storefront_url, storefront_admin_key)
rather than per-lease fields. One provisioning service instance serves one
storefront. In production these are injected via the provisioning-secrets
config profile.
