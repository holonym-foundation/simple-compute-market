"""Buyer-as-pure-client negotiation library.

The buyer doesn't run a storefront or any HTTP server. They pick a
seller, open a negotiation via HTTP, loop round-by-round until the
thread ends, and return the outcome. Every request is signed by the
buyer's wallet so the seller can verify without any prior
registration.

Public API:
    negotiate_with_seller(...) -> NegotiationOutcome

Per-round decisions go through ``market_policy.negotiation_middleware``
— same chain framework the seller uses. The buyer's default chain is
just the terminal strategy (``bisection`` or ``rl``); guards like
inventory match are seller-side.
